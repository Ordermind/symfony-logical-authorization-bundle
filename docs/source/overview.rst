Guidelines
----------

1. Guzzle utilizes PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4, and PSR-7.
2. Guzzle is meant to be lean and fast with very few dependencies. This means
   that not every feature request will be accepted.
3. Guzzle has a minimum PHP version requirement of PHP 5.5. Pull requests must
   not require a PHP version greater than PHP 5.5 unless the feature is only
   utilized conditionally.
4. All pull requests must include unit tests to ensure the change works as
   expected and to prevent regressions.


Running the tests
-----------------

In order to contribute, you'll need to checkout the source from GitHub and
install Guzzle's dependencies using Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle.git
    cd guzzle && curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php && ./composer.phar install --dev

Guzzle is unit tested with PHPUnit. Run the tests using the Makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

.. note::

    You'll need to install node.js v0.5.0 or newer in order to perform
    integration tests on Guzzle's HTTP handlers.


Reporting a security vulnerability
==================================

We want to ensure that Guzzle is a secure HTTP client library for everyone. If
you've discovered a security vulnerability in Guzzle, we appreciate your help
in disclosing it to us in a `responsible manner <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure>`_.

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk. If
you've discovered a security concern, please email us at
security@guzzlephp.org. We'll work with you to make sure that we understand the
scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. We consider
correspondence sent to security@guzzlephp.org our highest priority, and work to
address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.

After a security vulnerability has been corrected, a security hotfix release will
be deployed as soon as possible.
